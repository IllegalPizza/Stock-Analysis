# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project

The Purpose of the analysis was to compare the performance of Green Stocks over 2017 and 2018. The anaylsis began by reviewing the performance of Stock "DQ". Anaylsis showed that the stock did not perform well over the two years. Additional analysis was conducted to track the performance of 12 other Green Stocks over the same time period. 

## Results


Green Stocks as a whole preformed better in 2017 than in 2018. In 2018 only 2 stocks in our population showed a positive return. DQ was the best preforming stock in this population during 2017. In 2018, DQ was the worst preforming stock in this population during 2018. 




## Summary



Refactoring the code saved some processing time, and cleaned up the code making it easier to follow. The spreadsheet is easy to interface with, and can switch between worksheets seemlessly.
